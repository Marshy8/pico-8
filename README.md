# Pico-8 Game Collection

## Current Cartridge: Cellseekers
An arcade survival / reflex micro-game themed around navigating and reacting to dynamic entities (“cells”) with escalating pressure.

### Core Loop
- Spawn waves of reactive enemies.
- Player maneuvers and charges (see charging mini-game) for boosts.
- Score accumulation + difficulty scaling.
- Visual feedback via lighting pulses and soundtrack layers.
